The player to the right picks her card now, the movements of the player before her have stimulated strongly her memories, 
beliefs and emotional wounds. Her freedom, or impression of freedom is put to a test. 
The card she takes is to « not let be », whatever will be, she will oppose to it. Thoughts like « is not fair » will constantly appear. 
The calm went, the welcoming state leaves her, discomfort raises, nothing to thank anymore.
